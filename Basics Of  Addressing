-Assigned by manually or dynamically.
-Represented in decimal and it has 4 octets(x.x.x.x)
-0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255(32 bits)

MAC ADDRESS
-MAC stands for Media Access Control.
-Every node in the LAN is identified with the help of MAC address.

-Needed for communication               -Needed for communication
-32 bits                                -48 bits
-Represented in Decimal                 -Represented in hexadecimal
-Router needs IP Address to             - Switch needs MAC address to
forward data.                             forward data.

PORT ADDRESS OR PORT NUMBER
-In a node, many processes will be running.
-Data which are sent/received must reach the right process.
-Every process in a node is uniquely identified using port numbers.
-Port = communication endpoint
-Fixed port numbers and dynamic port numbers(0-65535)
