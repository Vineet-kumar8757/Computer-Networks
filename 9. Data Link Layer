Data Link layer
----------------
1. It is responsible for moving data(frames) from one node to another node.

Services provided by data link layer
- Framing
- Physical Addressing
- Flow Control
- Error Control
- Access Control

Framing
-------- 
1. The data link layer needs to pack bits into frames, so that each frame is 
  distinguishable from another.
2. Our postal system practices a type of framing.
3. The simple act of inserting a letter into an envelope separates one piece of
  information from another; the envelope serves as the delimiter.

Physical Addressing
-------------------
1. A frame is the encapsulation of the header and trailer information with the 
packet.
2. In the header, the source and the destination MAC address are dealt.

Flow Control
--------------
1. Flow Control is the one of the duties of data link control sublayer.
2. The flow control in data link layer is end to end flow control.
3. Speed matching mechanism.
4. Flow control coordinates the amount of data that can be sent before
receiving an acknowledgement.

Access Control
--------------
- Media Access Control

Error Control
-------------
- Error Detection
- Error Correction
