CLASSIFICATION OF COMPUTER NETWORKS
  1.Local Area Network (LAN)
  2. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
  3. Wide Area Network (WAN)

1. LOCAL AREA NETWORK (LAN)
A local area network(LAN) is a computer network that interconnects computers 
within a limited area such as a residence, school, laboratory, university, campus or office building.

LAN-DEVICES
- WiredLAN (Example: Ethernet-Hub, Switch)
- WirelessLAN (Example: Wi-Fi)

2. METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORK (MAN)
A metropolitan area network (MAN) is a computer network that interconnects users
with computer resources in a geographic region of the size of a metropolitan area
(city).

MAN-DEVICES
-Switches/Hub
-Routers/Bridges

3. WIDE AREA NETWORK (WAN)
A wide area network (WAN) is a telecommunication networks that extends over a large geographical
area for the primary purpose of computer networking.

WAN-Devices
End-devices and intermediary devices

NEW TRENDS
-Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)
-Online collaboration
-Cloud computing

STORAGE AREA NETWORK (SAN)

Cloud Computing
-It is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage
and computing power, without direct active management by the user.

NETWORK TOPOLOGY
-Arrangement of nodes of a computer network.
Topology = Layout

PHYSICAL TOPOLOGY AND LOGICAL TOPOLOGY
-Physical Topology - Placement of various nodes.
-Logical Topology - Deals with the data flow in the network.

NETWORK TOPOLOGY
- Bus
- Ring
- Star
- Mesh
- Hybrid

BUS TOPOLOGY
-All data transmitted between nodes in the network is transmitted over this
common transmission medium and is able to be received by all nodes in the 
network simultaneously.
- A signal containing the address of the intended receiving machine travels from
a source machine in both direction to all machines connected to the bus until
it finds the intended recipient.

Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages                              Disadvantages
-Only one wire- less expensive          Not fault tolerant(No redundancy)
-Suited for temporary network.          Limited cable length
-Node failures does not affect others.  No secuity

RING TOPOLOGY
-A ring topology is a bus topology in a closed loop.
-Peer-to-Peer LAN topology.
-Two connections: one to each of its nearest neighbours.
-Unidirectional
-Sending and receiving data takes place with the help of TOEKN.

Advantages                             Disadvantages
-Performance better than Bus           -Unidirectional: Single point of failure
topology.                               will affect the whole network.
-Can cause battleneck due to          - increase in load and decrease in performance
weak links.
-All nodes with equal access.         - No security

STAR TOPOLOGY
-Every node is connected to a central node called a hub or switch.
-Centralized management.
-All traffic must pass through the hub or switch.

Advantages                            Disadvantages
-Easy to design and implement.        -Single point of failure affects the whole network.
-Centralized administration           -Bottlenecks due to overloaded switch/Hub.
-Scalable                             - Increased cost due to switch/hub.

MESH TOPOLOGY
-Each node is directly connected to every other nodes in the network.
-Fault tolerant and reliable.

Advantages                            Diaadvantages
-Fault tolerant                       -Issues with broadcasting messages.
-Reliable                             -Expensive and impractical for large networks.

HYBRID TOPOLOGY
-Combination of one or more topology.
