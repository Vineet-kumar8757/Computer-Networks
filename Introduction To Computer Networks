DEFINITION- COMPUTER NETWORK
A computer network is a set of nodes connected by communication links.

Node- A node can be a computer, printer or any other device capable of sending/receiving data generated by other nodes in the network.

The link carries the information.
Links(Medium) ---> Wired: Cable
                    Wireless: Air
