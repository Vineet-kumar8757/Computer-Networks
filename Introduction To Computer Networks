DEFINITION- COMPUTER NETWORK
A computer network is a set of nodes connected by communication links.

Node- A node can be a computer, printer or any other device capable of sending/receiving data generated by other nodes in the network.
Examples of nodes: Computer, Server, Printer, Security Camera, Many more(Switches/Bridges/Routers etc.)

Communication Link - A communication link can be a wired link or wireless link.
The link carries the information.
Links(Medium) ---> Wired: Cable
                    Wireless: Air

BASIC CHARACTERISTICS OF COMPUTER NETWORK
* Fault Tolerance
* Scalability
* Quality of Service (QoS)
* Security

1) Fault Tolerance
-The ability to:
  1. Continue working despite failures
  2. Ensure no loss of service

2) Scalability
-The ability to:
  1. Grow based on the needs
  2. Have good performance after growth

3) Quality of Service (QoS)
- The ability to:
  1. Set Priorities
  2. Manage data traffic to reduce data loss, delay etc.
  
4) Security
- The ability to prevent:
  1. Unauthorized access
  2. Misuse
  3. Forgery
 -The ability to provide
  1. Confidentiality
  2. Integrity
  3. Availability
 
DATA COMMUNICATION
- Date communications are the exchange of data between two nodes via some form of 
  link(transmission medium) such as a cable.
  
Data flow
- Simplex
- Half Duplex
- Full Duplex

Data flow - Simplex
- Communication is always unidirectional.
- One device can transmit and the other device will receive.
- Example : Keyboards, Traditional monitors

Data flow - Half Duplex
- Communication is in both directions but not at the same time.
- If one device is sending, the other can only receive, and vice versa.
- Example: Walkie-Talkies

Data flow - Duplex or full Duplex
- Communication is in both directions simultaneously.
- Device can send and receive at the same time.
- Example: Telephone line

PROTOCOLS
- All communication schemes will have the following things in common:
  1. Source or sender
  2. Destination or receiver
  3. Channel or media
- Rules or protocols govern all the methods of communication

Protocol= Rule
It is a set of rules that govern data communication.
Protocol determines:
  - What is communicated?
  - How it is communicated?
  - When it is communicated?

PROTOCOLS - HUMAN COMMUNICATION
-Protocols are necessary for human communication and include:
  1. An identified sender and receiver.
  2. Common language and grammar.
  3. Speed and timing of delivery
  4. Confirmation or acknowledgement requirements
  
PROTOCOLS - NETWORK COMMUNICATION 
-Protocols used in network communications also define:
  1. Message encoding
  2. Message formatting and encapsulation
  3. Message timing
  4. Message size
  5. Message delivery options
 
ELEMENTS OF A PROTOCOL
  1. Message encoding
  2. Message formatting and encapsulation
  3. Message timing
  4. Message size
  5. Message delivery options

1. MESSAGE ENCODING
Message Source ---> Encoder (Signal) ---> Transmitter ---> Transmission Medium ---> Receiver ----> Decoder (Signal) ----> Message Destinaiton

2. MESSAGE FORMATTING AND ENCAPSULATION
Agreed format
Encapsulate the information to identify the sender and the receiver rightly.

3. MESSAGE SIZE
  - Humans break long messages into smaller parts or sentences.
  - Long messages must also be broken into smaller pieces to travel across a network.
 
4. MESSAGE TIMING
  -Flow control
  -Response Timeout

5. MESSAGE DELIVERY OPTIONS
  -Unicast ==> A sender is sending data to only one receiver.
  - Multicast ==> A sender is sending data to a set of receivers but not all.
  -Broadcast ==> A sender is sending data to all the participants of the network.
