CLASSIFICATION OF COMPUTER NETWORKS
  1.Local Area Network (LAN)
  2. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
  3. Wide Area Network (WAN)

1. LOCAL AREA NETWORK (LAN)
A local area network(LAN) is a computer network that interconnects computers 
within a limited area such as a residence, school, laboratory, university, campus or office building.

LAN-DEVICES
- WiredLAN (Example: Ethernet-Hub, Switch)
- WirelessLAN (Example: Wi-Fi)

2. METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORK (MAN)
A metropolitan area network (MAN) is a computer network that interconnects users
with computer resources in a geographic region of the size of a metropolitan area
(city).

MAN-DEVICES
-Switches/Hub
-Routers/Bridges

3. WIDE AREA NETWORK (WAN)
A wide area network (WAN) is a telecommunication networks that extends over a large geographical
area for the primary purpose of computer networking.

WAN-Devices
End-devices and intermediary devices

NEW TRENDS
-Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)
-Online collaboration
-Cloud computing

STORAGE AREA NETWORK (SAN)

Cloud Computing
-It is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage
and computing power, without direct active management by the user.

NETWORK TOPOLOGY
-Arrangement of nodes of a computer network.
Topology = Layout

PHYSICAL TOPOLOGY AND LOGICAL TOPOLOGY
-Physical Topology - Placement of various nodes.
-Logical Topology - Deals with the data flow in the network.

NETWORK TOPOLOGY
- Bus
- Ring
- Star
- Mesh
- Hybrid

BUS TOPOLOGY
-All data transmitted between nodes in the network is transmitted over this
common transmission medium and is able to be received by all nodes in the 
network simultaneously.
- A signal containing the address of the intended receiving machine travels from
a source machine in both direction to all machines connected to the bus until
it finds the intended recipient.
