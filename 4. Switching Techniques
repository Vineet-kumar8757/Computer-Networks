SWITCHING
-Switching in computer network helps in deciding the best route for
 data transmission if there are multiple paths in a larger network.
-One-to-One connection.

Types of Switching Techniques
1. Circuit Switching
2. Message Switching
3. Packet Switching
  - Datagram Approach
  - Virtual Circuit Approach

CIRCUIT SWITCHING
-A dedicated path is established between the sender and receiver.
- Before data transfer, connection will be established first.
-Example: Telephone network

3 PHASES IN CIRCUIT SWITCHING
 1. Connection establishment
 2. Data transfer
 3. Connection Disconnection

MESSAGE SWITCHING
-Store and forward mechanism.
-Message is transferred as a complete unit and forwarded using store
and forward mechanism at the intermediary node.
-Not suited for streaming media and real-time applications.

PACKET SWITCHING
-The internet is a packet switched network.
-Message is broken into individual chunks called as packets.
-Each packet is sent individually.
-Each packet will have source and destination IP address with 
sequence number.
-Sequence numbers will help the receiver to 
  - Reorder the packets
  -Detect missing packets and
  -Send acknoeledgements.
  
TWO APPROACHES TO PACKET SWITCHING
1. Datagram Approach
2. Virtual Circuit Approach

DATAGRAM APPROACH
-Datagram Packet Switching is also known as connectionless switching.
-Each independent entity is called as datagram.
-Datagrams contain destination information and the intermediary
devices uses this information to forward datagrams to right destination.
-In Datagram Packet Switching approach, the path is not fixed.
-Intermediate nodes take the routing decisions to forward the packets.
  
 PACKET SWITCHING- VIRTUAL CIRCUIT APPROACH
 -Virtual Circuit Switching is also known as connection-oriented
 switching.
 -In the case of Virtual circuit switching, a preplanned route is
 established before the messages are sent.
 -Call request and call accept packets are used to establish the 
 connection between sender and receiver.
 -In this approach, the path is fixed for the duration of a logical
 connection.
