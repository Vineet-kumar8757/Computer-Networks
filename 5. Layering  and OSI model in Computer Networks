LAYERING

-Layering means decomposing the problem into more manageable
components (Layers)

Advantages:
-It provides more modular design.
-Easy to troubleshoot.

PROTOCOLS
-It is a set of rules that governs data communication.
- The protocols in each layer governs the activities of the data
communication

LAYERED ARCHITECTURES
-The OSI Reference model
-The TCP/IP Model

THE OSI MODEL
-OSI stands for Open System Interconnection.
-It is a model for understanding and designing a network architecture
that is flexible, robust, and interoperable.
-Developed by the International Standards for Organizations (ISO).
-The OSI model is not a protocol.
-It is only a guideline and hence it is referred as OSI reference model.

-The purpose of the OSI model is to show how to facilitate
communication between different systems without requiring changes
to the logic of the underlying hardware and software.
- The OSI model was never fully implemented.

THE TCP/IP MODEL
- TCP/IP = Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol
- The TCP/IP protocol suite was developed prior to the OSI model.
- Therefore, the layers in the TCP/IP protocol suite do not exactly
match those in the OSI model.
- TCP/IP is a hierarchical protocol made up of interactive modules each
of which provides a specific functionality.
