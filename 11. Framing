Framing
-------
- Bits flow between adaptors, frames between hosts.
- Framing in the data link layer separates a frame distinguishable from
  another frame.
- Frame = Header + Network Layer PDU + Trailer
- In packet switched networks, the block of data called frames are exchanged
  between nodes, not  bits streams.
- When node A wishes to transmit a frame to node B, it tells its adaptor to
  transmit a frame from the node's memory.
- The results in a sequence of bits being sent over the link.
- The adaptor on node B then collects together the sequence of bits arriving 
  on the link and deposits the corresponding frame in B's memory.

Types of framing
------------------
1. Fixed-size framing
2. Variable-size framing

1. Fixed-size framimg
- Here the size of the frame is fixed and so the frame length acts as a delimuter
 of the frame.
-  Consequently, it does not require additional boundary bits to identify the
start and end of the frame.

2. Variable-size framing
-  Here, the size of each frame to be transmitted may be different.
