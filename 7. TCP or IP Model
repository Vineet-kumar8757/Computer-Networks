#Layers of TCP/IP Model
1. Application - Represents data to the user, plus encoding and dialog control.
2. Transport - Supports communication between diverse devices across diverse networks.
3. Internet - Determines the best path through the network.
4. Network Access - Controls the hardware devices and media that make up the network.

Network Access Layer - PPP, Ethernet, Interface Drivers

PROTOCOL DATA UNIT (PDU)
-Protocol Data Units(PDUs) are named according to the protocols of the TCP/IP suite:
data, segment, packet, frame, and bits.
    Application Layer - Data
    Transport Layer - Segment
    Network Layer - Packet
    Data Link Layer - Frame
    Physical Layer - Bits
