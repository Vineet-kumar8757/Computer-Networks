Data Link Sublayers
---------------------
1. Logical Link Control (LLC) or Data Link Control(DLC) Sublayer
- Handles communication between upper and lower layers.
- Takes the network protocol data and adds control information to help deliver
the packet to the destination. (Flow Control)

2. MAC Sublayer
- Constitutes the lower sublayer of the data link layer.
- Implemented by hardware, typically in the computer NIC.
- Two primary responsibilities
    1. Data encapsulation
    2. Media access control

1. Data encapsulation
- Frame assembly before transmission and frame diassembly upon reception of a frame.
- MAC layer adds a header and trailer to the network layer PDU.
- Provides three primary functions:
  - Framing
  - Physical Addressing or MAC addressing
  - Error control

2. Media Access Control
- Responsible for the placement of frames on the media and frames from the
  media.
- Communicates directly with the physical layer.
